            <p class="mt-10">
                GDYU or “Game Devs @ YorkU” was founded in November 2021 by Jayden Brooks. Back then, York hadn't returned to campus for the Fall ‘21 semester. A dedicated game development club had not existed, and so Brooks took the initiative.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-10">
                GDYU began as a small Discord server. Without proper registration, Brooks promoted GDYU as an “unofficial club”. People began showing up— enough for GDYU to apply as a real club, and in January 2022, our application was approved, and GDYU entered the big leagues!
